"About Kubachi",
`Kubachi is one of Dagestan's remarkable villages, known throughout the 
world as a village specialising in the manufacture of jewellery of 
precious metals. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
the village became famous for the artistic decoration of weapons and 
the manufacture of jewellery. The sources of the IX-X centuries mention 
the village as a country 'Zirehgeran'. Researchers believe that the term 
"Zirehgeran" did not refer to a certain village. <br/>A lot of 
interesting information about it has been collected and published in the
 articles of researchers from all over the world, who have studied the 
village. <br/>In distant past centuries, stories had circulated that 
there was an area where chainmail, martial arts equipment and weapons 
were produced and shipped to various countries. <br/>Some travellers 
have managed to penetrate to the fortress, located in the clouded heights, 
and they spread the word about this mountain forge. <br/>The numerous 
cemeteries around the village suggest that its inhabitants were`
,
` not 
only armourers and chain-smiths, but also carvers. The gravestones have 
beautifully interwoven inscriptions in the patterns, conveying the names 
of the deceased.<br/>The development of the decorative arts can be 
traced on the basis of the works of art. Not only gravestones but also 
watchtowers and house walls were traditionally carved in stone. Albanian 
stones had relief representations of animate beings - humans, beasts of 
prey, dragons and birds, cleverly interwoven with plant motifs. The very 
contours of figures, animal manes and tails, plumage of birds are also 
ornamented with exceptional rhythmic feeling. Everything was pictured by 
memory and imagination, so the patterns are not repeated.<br/>The heyday 
of smithing, goldsmithing, silversmithing and stone-carving in the 
village can be traced back centuries. The manufacture of chain mail, 
armour, spears, swords and other weapons is related to even deeper 
antiquity. <br/>Vague indications can be found in works of ancient 
historians as to when the development of`
,
` this craft began.<br/>The tight 
joints of the numerous rings that make up the chainmail prevented arrows 
from penetrating it. In addition, it well protected the body from blows 
of swords and daggers.<br/>In ancient times precious iron was mined in 
the territory of the village. It was produced from local ore found near 
their village, near the village of Chumli, in a gorge known as 
Khyabkoyla katala. Here, makeshift ovens made of local hard stones were 
built by the rocks. <br/>Traces of smelting in the form of slag remnants 
and impurities in the iron ore are still met to this day. Fire-burnt and 
brownish rocks also indicate that smelting of ore has been taking place 
here for a long time. This work was done by groups of smelters.<br/>When 
forging metal, the smiths carried out various operations: chopping, 
drawing, punching, twisting and stamping. They had various makeshift 
tools: pliers, hammers, chisels and punches. <br/>Hand-held sharpeners 
of local hard stone, fine and coarse sandstone 
were used to point sharp tools.`]
